# 4th Down! A Dice Football Game - Rulebook

## Game Overview

4th Down is a fast-paced, dice-driven football simulation game for 2 players. Each player controls a team competing to score the most points in a 60-minute game (two 30-minute halves).

## Objective

Score more points than your opponent by moving the ball down the field and scoring touchdowns (6-8 points) or field goals (3 points).

## Materials Needed

- **2 twenty-sided dice (d20)** numbered 1-20
- **1 ten-sided die (d10)** numbered 1-10
- **1 eight-sided die (d8)** numbered 1-8
- **Paper and pencil** for tracking field position, score, and time
- **This rulebook** with the drive outcome tables

**NOTE:** All dice use standard numbering (1 to max), making physical dice easy to use!

## Setup

1. **Choose Teams**: Each player selects a team (traditionally "Bombers" vs "Gunners")
2. **Initial Kickoff**: Flip a coin to determine who receives the opening kickoff
3. **Starting Position**: The receiving team starts at their own **30-yard line**
4. **Time**: Each half begins with **180 time blocks** (30 game minutes)
   - 1 time block = 10 seconds of game time

## Field Position

The field runs from 0 to 100 yards:
- **0 yards** = Bombers' goal line
- **100 yards** = Gunners' goal line

### Team Directions
- **Bombers** advance toward 100 (moving the ball up the field)
- **Gunners** advance toward 0 (moving the ball down the field)

## Game Structure

### Halves
- Two halves of 180 time blocks each (30 game minutes per half)
- Second half begins with a kickoff to the team that didn't receive in the first half

### Drives
Each team's possession is called a "drive." On each drive:
1. Choose a play style (Balanced, Run-First, or Pass-First)
2. Roll for the drive outcome
3. Check for turnovers
4. Resolve 4th down situations
5. Score points or change possession

## Turn Sequence

### Step 1: Choose Play Style

The offensive team chooses one of three play styles:

**BALANCED** - Even mix of running and passing
- Moderate yardage potential
- 10% turnover risk
- Average time consumption

**RUN-FIRST** - Focus on the ground game
- Lower yardage potential
- 5% turnover risk (safest)
- Higher time consumption

**PASS-FIRST** - Aggressive passing attack
- Highest yardage potential
- 20% turnover risk (riskiest)
- Lowest time consumption

### Step 2: Roll for Drive Outcome

**Roll a d20 (1-20)** and consult the appropriate table below for your chosen play style.

The result shows:
- **Yards gained** (or lost, if negative)
- **Time blocks consumed**

#### PASS-FIRST OFFENSE TABLE

| Roll | Yards | Time |
|------|-------|------|
| 1    | -10   | 2    |
| 2    | -5    | 3    |
| 3    | 0     | 4    |

| 16   | 80    | 36   |
| 17   | 90    | 40   |
| 18   | TD    | 1-20 |
| 19   | TD    | 1-20 |
| 20   | TD    | 1-20 |

**Special Note for TD Results:**
- If you roll "TD", the time consumed is **1-20** time blocks
- Roll a d20 to determine the actual time used
- Cap the time at the yards needed to score (see Time Cap Rule below)

### Step 3: Check for Turnover

**Roll a second d20 (1-20)** to check for a turnover:

- **Balanced**: Turnover on rolls **1-2** (10% chance)
- **Run-First**: Turnover on roll **1** only (5% chance)
- **Pass-First**: Turnover on rolls **1-4** (20% chance)

**If a turnover occurs:**
- The drive ends immediately
- If the drive result was a TD, the TD is negated and the opponent gets the ball at their 20-yard line
- Otherwise, the opponent gets the ball at the current field position
- Subtract the time consumed from the clock
- **No punt or field goal attempt**

**If no turnover:**
- Continue to Step 4

### Step 4: Apply Yards and Check for Safety

Move the ball the number of yards indicated by the drive roll.

**SAFETY CHECK:**
If the ball reaches or goes past the offense's own goal line (0 for Bombers, 100 for Gunners):
- **SAFETY!** The opponent scores **2 points**
- The opponent receives the ball at their own 30-yard line
- Subtract time consumed and proceed to the opponent's drive
- **Do not check for turnovers** (safety happens first)

### Step 5: Check for Touchdown

**If the ball reaches or crosses the opponent's goal line:**
1. **Touchdown!** Award **6 points**
2. Proceed to Extra Point Attempt (see Scoring section)
3. After scoring, opponent receives kickoff at their 30-yard line
4. Subtract time consumed from the clock

**If not a touchdown:**
- Continue to Step 6 (4th Down Decision)

### Step 6: 4th Down Decision

After a normal drive result (not TD or turnover), the offense faces 4th down.

#### Determine Yards to Go

Roll to determine how many yards needed for a first down:
- **Run-First**: Roll **d8** (1-8 yards)
- **Balanced**: Roll **d10** (1-10 yards)
- **Pass-First**: Roll **d20** (1-20 yards)

**Special Case - 4th and Goal:**
If the yards rolled is greater than or equal to the distance to the goal line, it's **4th and goal** from the current position.

#### Decision Options

The offense must choose one:

**A) GO FOR IT** - Attempt to gain a first down or score
**B) KICK FIELD GOAL** - Attempt 3 points (only if within 50 yards of goal)
**C) PUNT** - Kick the ball away to opponent

**Deciding to Go For It:**
Players may decide based on game situation, but common guidelines:
- **4th and 1-3**: Consider going for it (especially near goal)
- **4th and 4-5**: Sometimes go for it if close to goal or trailing
- **4th and 6+**: Usually kick/punt unless desperate
- **Late in game when trailing**: More aggressive

#### A) Going For It - 4th Down Conversion

**Roll a d20 (1-20)** and consult this table:

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1    | -10    |
| 2    | -5     |
| 3    | 0      |
| 4    | 1      |
| 5    | 1      |
| 6    | 2      |
| 7    | 2      |
| 8    | 3      |
| 9    | 3      |
| 10   | 4      |
| 11   | 4      |
| 12   | 5      |
| 13   | 6      |
| 14   | 7      |
| 15   | 8      |
| 16   | 10     |
| 17   | 14     |
| 18   | 20     |
| 19   | 30     |
| 20   | TD     |

**Resolution:**

1. **If result is "TD"**: Automatic touchdown! Score 6 points + extra point attempt, opponent gets kickoff.

2. **If yards gained reaches the end zone**: Touchdown! Score 6 points + extra point attempt, opponent gets kickoff.

3. **If yards gained ≥ yards to go**: **FIRST DOWN!**
   - The same team keeps the ball at the new position
   - Begin a new drive (go back to Step 1 - choose a new play style)
   - **Do not subtract time again** (already subtracted from initial drive roll)

4. **If yards gained < yards to go**: **TURNOVER ON DOWNS**
   - Opponent gets the ball at the new position
   - Change possession

#### B) Field Goal Attempt

**Requirements:**
- Ball must be within **50 yards** of opponent's goal line
- If beyond 50 yards, you must punt instead

**Procedure:**
1. **Roll a d20 (1-20)** and consult this table:

| Roll | Make Distance |
|------|---------------|
| 1    | 0 yards       |
| 2    | 15 yards      |
| 3    | 20 yards      |
| 4    | 25 yards      |
| 5    | 30 yards      |
| 6    | 30 yards      |
| 7    | 30 yards      |
| 8    | 30 yards      |
| 9    | 35 yards      |
| 10   | 35 yards      |
| 11   | 35 yards      |
| 12   | 35 yards      |
| 13   | 40 yards      |
| 14   | 40 yards      |
| 15   | 40 yards      |
| 16   | 40 yards      |
| 17   | 45 yards      |
| 18   | 45 yards      |
| 19   | 45 yards      |
| 20   | 45 yards      |

2. Compare the **Make Distance** to the actual distance to the goal line

**If Make Distance ≥ Actual Distance:**
- **FIELD GOAL GOOD!** Award **3 points**
- Opponent receives kickoff at their 30-yard line

**If Make Distance < Actual Distance:**
- **FIELD GOAL MISS**
- Opponent gets the ball **7 yards back** from the kick spot
- If this would be beyond their 20-yard line, they get it at their 20-yard line instead

#### C) Punt

- Opponent receives the ball **40 yards downfield** from current position
- If this would be beyond their 20-yard line (touchback), they get the ball at their 20-yard line
- Change possession

## Scoring

### Touchdowns (6 points)

When a team scores a touchdown, they immediately attempt an extra point conversion.

#### Extra Point Attempt

The scoring team must choose:

**1-POINT CONVERSION** (Safer - ~85% success rate)
- Roll a d20 (1-20) on the Field Goal table above
- **Success if Make Distance ≥ 15 yards**
- Success = 7 points total (6 + 1)
- Failure = 6 points total

**2-POINT CONVERSION** (Riskier - 40% success rate)
- Roll a d10 (1-10)
- **Success on 7 or higher**
- Success = 8 points total (6 + 2)
- Failure = 6 points total

**Strategic Considerations:**
Late in the game (60 time blocks or less remaining), teams trailing may attempt 2-point conversions:
- Down by 8+: 2-point helps cut deficit
- Down by 7: 2-point takes the lead (1-point only ties)
- Down by 6: 1-point takes the lead (safer than 2-point)

### Field Goals (3 points)

Scored by successfully kicking a field goal on 4th down (see above).

### Safeties (2 points)

When the offense is pushed back to or beyond their own goal line, the **defense** scores 2 points and receives the ball at their own 30-yard line.

## Time Management

### Time Blocks

- Each half has **180 time blocks** (30 game minutes)
- 1 time block = 10 seconds
- Subtract time after each drive result

### TD Time Cap Rule

When you gain enough yards to score a touchdown:
1. Find the **smallest non-TD table row** with yards ≥ yards needed to score
2. If you rolled "TD", roll d20 for time
3. Use the **minimum** of your roll and that row's time value

**Example:** Bombers at the 30-yard line need 70 yards to score. They roll TD with Balanced.
- Smallest Balanced row with ≥70 yards is row 15 (68 yards, 38 time)
- Roll d20 and get 12 time blocks
- Use 12 time blocks (minimum of 12 and 38)

### Late Half Rule

If remaining time is less than the drive time indicated:
1. Use the **largest non-TD row** that leaves at least 1 time block remaining
2. Adjust yards to that row's yards
3. Check for safety, then check for touchdown, then check for turnover
4. If none of those occur, the **offensive player has a choice**:

**UNTIMED DOWN OPTIONS:**

The offensive player may choose ONE of the following:

**A) LET HALF END** - The half ends immediately with no further action

**B) ATTEMPT FIELD GOAL** - If within 50 yards of the goal line
- Roll on the Field Goal table
- If successful: Award 3 points, opponent receives kickoff
- If missed: No points scored
- Half ends after the attempt

**C) GO FOR IT** - Attempt to score like a 4th down conversion
- Roll d20 on the 4th Down Conversion table
- If result is "TD" or reaches end zone: Score touchdown (6 points) + extra point attempt, opponent receives kickoff
- If result fails to score: No points scored
- Half ends after the attempt

**Strategic Notes:**
- This applies at the end of BOTH halves
- The choice is strategic - weigh the risk vs. reward based on score and field position
- If you're in close FG range and need points, attempting the FG is often wise
- If trailing and close to the goal, going for it might be the better choice
- If leading comfortably, you might just let the half end

## Kickoffs

After scoring (TD or FG) or safety:
- Opponent receives the ball at their **30-yard line**
- Begin a new drive

## Game End

- After the second half's time reaches 0
- Team with the most points wins
- If tied, game ends in a tie

## Quick Reference

### Turnover Thresholds
- **Run**: 1 (5%)
- **Balanced**: 1-2 (10%)
- **Pass**: 1-4 (20%)

### Field Goal Range
- Within **50 yards** of opponent's goal line

### Kickoff Position
- **30-yard line** for receiving team

### Punt Distance
- **40 yards** (touchback at 20)

### Missed FG Ball Placement
- **7 yards back** from kick spot (minimum at their 20)

### Safety Scoring
- **2 points** to defense
- Offense receives ball at their **30**

---

## Example Drive

**Situation:** Bombers have the ball at their own 30-yard line. 150 time blocks remain in the first half. Score is tied 0-0.

1. **Choose Play Style**: Player chooses **Balanced**
2. **Roll Drive**: Rolls **13** → Result is **45 yards, 31 time blocks**
3. **Check Turnover**: Rolls **8** → No turnover (safe)
4. **Apply Yards**: 30 + 45 = **75-yard line**
5. **Check TD**: Not in end zone (need 100)
6. **4th Down Distance**: Rolls d10 → Gets **6 yards to go**
7. **Decision**: 25 yards from goal, decides to kick FG
8. **FG Attempt**: Rolls d20 → Gets **14** → Make Distance = **40 yards**
   - Actual distance = 25 yards
   - 40 ≥ 25 → **FIELD GOAL GOOD!**
9. **Result**: Bombers score **3 points**, Gunners receive kickoff at their 30
10. **Time**: 150 - 31 = **119 time blocks** remaining
