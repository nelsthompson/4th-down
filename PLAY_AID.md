## Game Rules Summary

### Field Position
- Field coordinates: 0 (Bombers goal) to 100 (Gunners goal)
- Kickoffs start at team's own 30-yard line
- Field goal range: Within 35 yards of opponent's goal

### Time
- Each half: 180 time blocks (30 minutes game time)
- 1 time block = 10 seconds

### Drive Outcomes
- **Touchdown (TD):** Score 7 points, opponent receives kickoff
- **Field Goal Range:** Within 50 yards (distance-dependent)
  - **0-10 yards:** Roll 1d6, good on 2+ (83.3%)
  - **11-20 yards:** Roll 1d6, good on 3+ (66.7%)
  - **21-30 yards:** Roll 1d6, good on 4+ (50%)
  - **31-40 yards:** Roll 1d6, good on 5+ (33.3%)
  - **41-50 yards:** Roll 1d6, good on 6 (16.7%)
  - **Miss:** Opponent gets ball 7 yards back (min their 20)
- **Punt:** Opponent gets ball 40 yards downfield (touchback at their 20)
- **Turnover (Roll d20 for each drive):**
  - **Run-first:** Turnover on 0 (5% chance)
  - **Balanced:** Turnover on 0-1 (10% chance)
  - **Pass-first:** Turnover on 0-2 (15% chance)
  - **Effect:** No punt/FG, opponent gets ball at current spot
  - **If TD:** TD negated, opponent gets ball at their 20
- **4th Down Conversions:**
  - **After each non-TD drive:** Roll d10 (1-10) for yards to go
  - **If yards to go ≥ distance to goal:** It's 4th and goal
  - **AI Decision:** Team decides whether to go for it based on:
    - Field position (more likely near goal)
    - Yards to go (more likely on 4th and short)
    - Game situation (trailing, late game)
  - **If going for it:** Roll d10 again
    - **Success if roll > yards to go:** Move ball forward by roll amount
    - **If reaches goal line:** Touchdown (7 points)
    - **Otherwise:** Same team starts fresh drive from new position
    - **If unsuccessful:** Turnover on downs (opponent gets ball)

### TD Time Cap Rule
When you roll a TD or gain enough yards to reach the end zone:
1. Roll 1d20 for time
2. Find the smallest non-TD row with yards ≥ yards needed
3. Use the minimum of the d20 roll and that row's time

### Late Half Rule
If time remaining is less than the drive time:
- Use the largest non-TD row that leaves ≥1 block
- If in FG range, attempt FG and half ends
- Otherwise, half ends immediately

### Play Style Selection (AI)
**With ≤60 blocks remaining (~10 min):**
- Trailing: 55% Pass, 35% Balanced, 10% Run
- Leading: 50% Run, 40% Balanced, 10% Pass
- Tied: 40% Pass, 45% Balanced, 15% Run

**Otherwise:**
- 50% Balanced, 30% Pass, 20% Run
